## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
source("5.3 Analyser/Programs/Make raw/Make Raw.R")
source("5.3 Analyser/Programs/Make td/Make td.R")
source("5.3 Analyser/Programs/Make ad/Make ad.R")
```
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


test <- function(data, var, group){
  data %>% 
    group_by({{group}}) %>% 
    summarise(mean = mean({{var}}))
}

test(mtcars, mpg, gear)
test(adae, anyae, rantrt)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
